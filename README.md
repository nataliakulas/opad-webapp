## One Picture a Day

Preview: https://opad.surge.sh

Web Application, hosted on surge, based on React and with images hosting at Firebase.

The idea was to create an app, that will be the form of picture diary, where you can put one picture a day. 
Today we have a lot of app, when we can share pictures. 
I wanted to have something just for me, to remeber each and every day.

Functionalites are: 
- viewing gallery
- adding new pictures - only one for day
- adding pictures to favorites, deleting them and downloading
- viewing favorites
- viewing fluke picture

App is still being developed, so in near future there will be some more functionalites and existing bugs will be fixed.
